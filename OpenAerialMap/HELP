Step-by-step guide for an upload request.

* Step 1: Selection of imagery to be uploaded among layers currently loaded on
the QGIS map canvas or any local file. After adding imagery, the user can
change the order in which the upload will be performed.

* Step 2: Input of information that will compose the metadata sent to OAM
catalog, along with some auto-extracted data from the imagery files
(projection, bbox, file size). At this moment users can specify if the imagery
should be reprojected to EPSG:3857 or not. Finally, accept to release the image
under CC-BY 4.0 and allow tracing in OSM.

* Step 3: Review of final metadata info, select if the OAM catalog should be
imediately notified of the new resource and if a tile service should be
created, choose the upload destination and finally perform the upload.

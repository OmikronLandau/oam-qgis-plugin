How to upload the imagery and metadata
======================================

Step 1: Select imagery
----------------------
Select imagery from layers currently loaded on the QGIS map canvas
or any local file. After adding imagery, the user can change the order in which
the upload will be performed.

Step 2: Create metadata
-----------------------
Input/edit the metadata information, using textbox and combobox on
the right side. Select the images which you like to create the metadata of, and
click 'Save'. The plugin automatically extracts the information from the imagery,
and create the OIN-conformed metadata with user input data. You can reproject
the imagery to EPSG:3857, if you select the checkbox.

Step 3: Review and Upload
-------------------------
Review the content of metadata, and click 'Start Upload' button. If
download successfully starts, progressbar should show up, and keep informing the
status of upload.
